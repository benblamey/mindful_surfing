Mindful Browsing
================

A Chrome browser extension to help avoid wasting excessive time -- or retain "mindfulness" when browsing.

Unlike many other extensions which block time on specific 'distracting' sites, this extension instead focuses on the time the browser has been running.

Two features, each of which can be enabled independently:

1. An absolute limit on the duration of the browser session, after this time, the browser will be closed. Notifications warn of  pending shutdown.
2. Show a notification on time interval, reminding you how much time you have spent online.

All the time limits can be configured, and a URL white-list is supported - when the active tab matches the white-list, features are disabled.

Tip
---
If you decide to enable the feature to automatically close the browser, you might wish to enable persistence of the tabs:
    Settings > On startup > "continue where you left off"
    
Note
----
This extension is supposed to be annoying -- the point of it is to distract you from mindless surfing!
