publish to store



NICE TO HAVE
------------
donation facility

open page instead of showing notification
only count time when window is active
note: notifications put in system try when window not actie (or notification simply not shown/seen when window not actie)

double-check that all chrome API methods are being used asynchronously/properly
shutdown should fire on an interval
use local storage
refactor: "interval" > "period"
days / hours matrix for enabling
reset to default options button
random messages
refactor alarm info to use prototype
debug option to switch back to debug durations
