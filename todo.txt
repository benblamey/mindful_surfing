NICE TO HAVE
------------
get rid of alarm names
do alarm names need to be unique? simplify
shutdown should fire on an interval
use local storage
refactor: "interval" > "period"
days / hours matrix for enabling
reset to default options button
random messages
refactor alarm info to use prototype
debug option to switch back to debug durations
